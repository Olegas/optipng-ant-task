This is optipng-ant-task, an Apache Ant task for optimizing PNG images.
Under the hood this task uses (and requires) OptiPNG, see:

   http://optipng.sourceforge.net/

This Ant task has been tested with the following combination of software:

   - J2SE 5.0 and Java SE 6 (source code uses Java 5-features)
   - Ant 1.7.1
   - OptiPNG 0.6.3

This software is available under the terms of a BSD-style license, see
the accompanied LICENSE file.

This task comes as a collection of Java source files that can be built with Ant.
Just run:

   ant

The result will be a JAR file:

   build/optipng-ant-task.jar

Example usage of the task in an Ant build file:

   <taskdef name="optipng"
       classname="com.pensioenpage.jynx.optipng.MinifyPNGTask"
       classpath="lib/optipng-ant-task.jar" />

   <optipng dir="src/htdocs" todir="build/htdocs" />

Although all parameters are optional, the task supports various:

   process  - flag that indicates if the input files should be processed at
              all; there are 3 possible values:

                 "yes" - the files must be processed by OptiPNG, if OptiPNG
                         is unavailable, then this task will fail (alternative
                         is "true");

                 "no"  - the files must not be processed by OptiPNG but must
                         instead just be copied as-is, unchanged (alternative
                         is "false");

                 "try" - if OptiPNG is available process the file(s), but if
                         OptiPNG is unavailable, then just copy the files
                         instead (in this case a warning will be output);

   dir      - the source directory, to read PNG image files from, defaults to
              the project base directory;

   todir    - the destination directory, to write the generated CSS files to,
              defaults to the source directory;

   command  - the command to execute, by default the task uses 'optipng';

   timeOut  - the time-out in milliseconds for executing a single command,
              defaults to 60000 (meaning 60 seconds);

   includes - the files in the source directory to include, defaults to
              '*.png';

   excludes - the files to exclude, even if they are matched by the includes;

and other parameters inherited from the MatchingTask, see:
